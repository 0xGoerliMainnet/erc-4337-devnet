A simple Docker setup to deploy ERC-4337 infrastructure on your local dev environment.

## Usage

The following command will deploy a local devnet with all the required ERC-4337 infrastructure components ready to go.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Your dev env will be ready once you see the following log:

```
erc-4337-devnet-deploy-v0.6.0-1 exited with code 0
```

**You can point you local applications to `http://localhost:8545` for access to all node and bundler RPC methods.**

## Components

The ERC-4337 devnet is composed of several pieces:

- `node`: go-ethereum running in dev mode. It runs the [ERC-4337 Execution Client](https://github.com/stackup-wallet/erc-4337-execution-clients) build to leverage native bundler tracers.
- `bundler`: stackup-bundler that depends on `node` for the underlying ethereum client.
- `proxy`: [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/en/) server used to proxy JSON-RPC methods to the `node` or `bundler`.
- `fund-bundler`: A one off command to fund the bundler EOA on startup.
- `deploy-v0.6`: A one off command to deploy `v0.6` ERC-4337 contracts.
